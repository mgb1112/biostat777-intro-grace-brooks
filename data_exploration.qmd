**Information on Data**

With this data analysis, I intend to explore the offensive statistics of MLB teams in 2023. Specifically, I want to dive into the "3 True Outcomes of Baseball". On top of these, I would like to look at hits and the various breakdowns of numbers of singles, double, triples, and home runs throughout all teams as well as team batting average and how it compares to the league average. This data analysis would be helpful for baseball statisticians, avid baseball fans, and potentially the MLB (although I'm sure they have their own people doing more in-depth analyses than this. The data that I am using for this sample data analysis is from the "Lahman" R package. This R package stores tables from the 'Sean Lahman Baseball Database'. Specifically, I focused on the "Teams" table, which houses yearly stats and standings for MLB teams.

The Three True Outcomes of Baseball are the offensive outcomes that do not rely on the defensive team (other than pitcher and catcher) to occur. These are walks (BB), strikeouts(SO), and home runs(HR)

::: callout-note
This plot shows pretty consistent band thicknesses across the teams with slight spikes where teams have more hits total. Interesting further analysis could look at this same plot as percentages instead of counts.

**Summary**

The three plots I decided to make were (1) The Three True Offensive Outcomes of Baseball faceted by the League, (2) The breakdown of hits for each team in the league by number of bases, and (3) The team batting averages in 2023 with a line representing the total league average. In the first plot, the spikes roughly lined up with the teams. It was rare that a team had a spike in one of the three outcomes, and not in the others. The second plot I left at counts because I wanted to be able to see the spikes in numbers. It was interesting to see that the thickness of the different bands seems to be pretty similar for every team. Had I looked at the bands as percentages, I wonder how similar they all would have been. The final plot looks at batting average. I found this really interesting as there is a pretty small range in betting averages across the league. I wonder how much this would vary if we looked at the team by year, which would require a slightly different data set. I think that this is a very baseline analysis that could be explored a lot more. Baseball is a complex sport so looking at these are definitely only snapshots. I think as a whole, this reveals that looking at strictly offensive statistics, we cannot capture the game as a whole. If we look at TEX who won the World Series in 2023, they are above average, but not the peak in any of our plots. This shows that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than just hits, strikeouts, and walks.
